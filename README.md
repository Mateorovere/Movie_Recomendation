# üé¨ AI Movie Recommender System - Senior Level Project

A comprehensive movie recommendation system with machine learning and an interactive web interface.


### Step 1: Get TMDb API Key

1. Go to https://www.themoviedb.org/
2. Create a free account
3. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí API
4. Request an API key
5. Copy your API Key

### Step 2: Collect Movie Data


This script will:
- Fetch 1,000+ popular movies from TMDb
- Enrich data with details (cast, crew, genres, keywords)
- Save to `movies_dataset.csv` (~500 movies enriched, customizable)
- Takes approximately 15-30 minutes (due to API rate limits)

### Step 3: Train the Model

This will:
- Load the dataset
- Create TF-IDF feature vectors
- Compute similarity matrices
- Save the trained model to `movie_recommender.pkl`
- Takes 2-5 minutes depending on dataset size

### Step 4: Launch the Web App

```bash
streamlit run src/api/st-interface.py
```

The app will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## üß† Machine Learning Algorithms

### 1. Content-Based Filtering
- **TF-IDF Vectorization**: Converts movie metadata into numerical features
- **Features Used**: Plot overview, genres, keywords, cast, director
- **Similarity Metric**: Cosine similarity
- **Advantage**: Works well for new users, doesn't need ratings

### 2. Hybrid Recommendation
Combines multiple signals:
```python
hybrid_score = 0.5 √ó content_similarity +
               0.3 √ó normalized_rating +
               0.2 √ó normalized_popularity
```

### 3. Genre-Based Filtering
- Filters movies by selected genre
- Ranks by weighted score of rating and popularity
